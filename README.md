Routing
=======

Uses Google's DistanceMatrix API to generate a routing approximation
Run App.java to establish the server
An example URL: localhost/route/Pittsburgh&Los+Angeles&Vancouver

This project was meant as a learning experience for me to gain experience utilizing a Web Service such as
the Distance Matrix API.  I understand many of the aspects of the program have room for improvement because
I learned as I wrote the program and would like to go back and make it better.
TODO:
1)Set up maven build and adjust program to be able to run from a program such as tomcat
2)Implement an approximation algorithm for >30 cities
3)Integrate Spring
4)Clean up classes 
5)Implement an actual use case (website, app, program) that would consume this
6)Return an xml/json result rather than a plaintext result
7)Implement/redo test classes
8)Generate classses rather than using handwritten ones
9)Update documentation
